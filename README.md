1. Fetch patients from the `api.js` and display each patient inside of a card containing first name, last name, sex, date of birth (MM/dd/yyyy), and conditions.

2. Create a layout where we have patient cards distributed in 4 columns (content is left to right, top to bottom).

3. Create a search box at the top where patients are filtered by the search term.

4. Create 4 buttons at the top to sort patients by first name, last name, sex, and date of birth respectively. Upon a second click, the sort should be inverted.
